<h3> Gender </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
  Women make up 21% of respondents and students in the class, which is less than the percent of women in tech (<a href="https://builtin.com/women-tech/women-in-tech-workplace-statistics">25%</a>).
  </span>
  The class saw a 3% increase in women representation from 1A to 4B, in first year, 
  18% of the class were women.
  <br /> <br />
  There are many on-campus communities that support the success of women in
  Computer Science and Engineering at UWaterloo. For example,
  <a href="https://sesoc.uwaterloo.ca/wise">Women in Software (WiSE)</a>,
  <a href="http://wics.uwaterloo.ca/">Women in Computer Science (WiCS)</a>,

<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
  Students come from many different ethnic backgrounds.

  There is a significant number of respondents who identify as Caucasian or East Asian
  Asians. There is also more ethnic diversity among men than among women respondents, 
  as most women respondents are East Asian.
  <br /> <br />
  There are many on-campus communities that support ethnic minorities on campus
  such as
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nsbe.waterloo/">National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE)</a>,

<h2> International Students, Immigration and Home Location </h2>
<h3> International Students </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
  8.4% of respondents are international students, however, according to the official headcount
  12.9% of the students in the class are international students.
  </span>
  The class saw a 2.1% decrease in international students from 1A (15%) to 4B.
  This could be due to the higher tuition costs for international students, especially in Engineering.
  International term tuition fees, prior to the academic year 2018/19 where it was subject to a 62.1% fee increase, 
  were around $15000 for Computer Science students. This made the Computer Science program more cost beneficial to
  international students.
  <br /> <br />
  International students came from countries such as China and India.

<h2> Family background </h2>

  More than half of respondents come from families whose income is higher than
  the median Canadian family income (<a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1110001201">$96,080</a>).

  University. The majority of respondents have a family income between $50,000 and $200,000.

<h3> Level of education </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
  There are more parents with Master's and Doctorates combined than those with Bachelors.
  </span>
  Compared to our parents, only 3 respondents are planning on attending
  grad school. This could
  be a generational shift, or could be because entering the software industry does not require
  a Master's or Doctorate.

<h3>CEGEP</h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
  All students from Quebec attended CEGEP partially, meaning they did not graduate.
  </span>
  The Quebec schooling system requires students to finish CEGEP, a 2-year post-secondary diploma,
  before enrolling in a Quebec university. This is in part due to secondary school finishing
  in grade 11 and most Quebec undergraduate programs having a duration of 3 years. Quebec students who
  intend to attend universities outside of the province can apply after completing their "grade 12" (CEGEP 1).

<div class="half second">

<h3>CEGEP Fields</h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
  The respondents who attended CEGEP prevalently pursued a Pure and Applied Sciences diploma.
  </span>
  CEGEP attendees primarily choose between Pure and Applied Sciences and Health sciences if
  they pursue a science pre-university diploma. Some CEGEPs also offer a Computer Science and
  Mathematics pre-university diploma. On top of pre-university programs, most CEGEP catalogues
  contain 3-year technical programs in various fields, such as Engineering Technology, Nursing,
  and Computer Science.
  <br /><br />
  Some CEGEP course credits may be converted into university credits. For Software Engineering,
  incoming students who have completed two years of CEGEP along with Calculus II and Calculus III
  may convert those credits into an equivalent completion of <a href="https://uwflow.com/course/math117">
  MATH 117 (Calculus 1 for Engineering)</a>.

<h2> Others </h2>

<h3>Programming Knowledge</h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
  5.6% of respondents did not know how to program prior to starting at UWaterloo.
  </span>
  Programming knowledge is a required admission criterion to join the Software Engineering
  program at the University of Waterloo.
  The non-zero amount of students who had no prior coding experience could be due to transfer
  student responses, among other reasons.
