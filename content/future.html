<h3> Post-graduation plans </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    As of 5 months before graduation, 77% of students already have an offer, and 15% of students are
    still looking for a job.
  </span>
  7 students are planning to do graduate studies after
  graduating. Although most of the class plans to join the workforce immediately,
  34% of students are considering grad school in the future.
  <br/><br/>

  Even though 80% of the class has worked in California, less than half of
  students have chosen to live in California after graduating. Although California
  is perceived by many as the place to be for software engineers, seeing the gap
  in the conversion rate suggests that there are many other great places for
  software engineers such as East Coast Canada, East Coast US and Pacific North
  West US.

<h3> Motivations </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    Good compensation and growth as an engineer were the main
    factors affecting post-graduation plans.
  </span>
  This could explain why California was a popular choice for full-time location.
  <br /><br />
  Although family may be the least popular factor, most students working away
  from home have expressed interest in working near their families in the
  future.

<h3> Debt </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    65% of students are graduating debt-free.
  </span>
  30% of students have less than $30,000 in debt. Among students who are
  in debt, the median debt is $22,500.
  <br /><br />
  It's important to note that there were students from each family income bracket
  who graduated debt-free.
  All students with family income higher than $200,000 graduated debt-free.

<h3> Advice </h3>
<p class="full">
  <span class="big">
    "Figure out which advice applies best to you and ignore the rest."
  </span>
  The following is a summary of the advice shared by students with the
  intention of being shared with both prospective and current SE students.
  Many of the sentences
  are directly quoted or rephrased from the original advice.
  <br />
  <p class="quote">
  Your success should not be defined by others. Just because someone else is better than you at
  something, it does not mean that you're failing. Instead, be open and realize
  you can learn something from everyone. Realize that your peers' successes
  should be motivation rather than a reason to put yourself down.
  <br /><br />
  Find value in modesty, empathy, and courage. Learn to develop good habits
  early on, and budget your time based on your options and priorities. These
  skills are indispensable during university. Find a hobby you love. That
  hobby just might be software engineering, or it could be something completely
  different like drawing video game characters.
  <br /><br />
  Stop worrying about marks. They don't get you far unless you're looking at
  post graduate studies. This also means that you should know when to stop working
  on assignments to work on other things. "After graduation, I won't remember
  many of the bogus technical concepts. I will, however, remember the late
  nights in the SE lab with friends, fooling around while doing a last minute
  assignment."
  <br /><br />
  Try out as many different co-ops as possible. And don't Cali or continuous.
  It's tough to get your first job, but don't give up. And if you get a co-op at
  a big company, it does not mean that you're at the top of the world.
  <br /><br />
  And most importantly, university goes by in a flash, so enjoy it!

<h3> Moving home </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    27% of students plan to return to their home country after moving away.
  </span>
  Moving away is a big change. There's a fairly even split among students who would like to return home or stay abroad, while the rest of students haven't decided yet.
  This goes to show that everyone has different goals and each student should find what's important to them.
  <br/><br/>
  One common tip from alumni is to pursue what makes you happy and aligns with your values.
  This way, you can find the most happiness in what you do, whether that's close to home or abroad.
