<h1 id="coop"> Co-op </h1>
<h3> Companies </h3>
<p class="full">
  <span class="big">
    At least 300 companies from 58 different cities have hired an SE student.
  </span>
  Students had the opportunity to work in many different types of environments,
  including working at a 5 person startup, writing code in Kenya,
  researching with professors, and working at a big tech company.
  While a majority of students were software engineers during their co-ops,
  some explored other areas such as design, product management, finance and consulting.
  <br /> <br />
  The benefit of having 6 co-op terms is that students get to explore different
  company sizes doing different positions in different cities. This is
  invaluable for students because it helps students figure out what they want
  upon graduation.

<h3> Locations </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    91% of students co-oped in at least 2 different countries.
  </span>
  One of the factors behind only 9% of students interning in Canada were
  restrictions from work visas which primarily affects non-Canadians.
  <br /><br />
  The majority that co-oped in the US worked in California and specifically in Silicon Valley.
  One of the reasons for this is because Silicon Valley is the headquarters for many
  large tech companies that hire software engineers such as Google, Facebook,
  Apple, etc.
  <br /><br />
  During 5 of the 6 co-op terms, there was at least one student working outside
  of North America. This included cities such as Stockholm, Nairobi, Phnom
  Penh, Shanghai, Tokyo, etc.

<h3> Favourite Locations </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    31% of students that worked in California preferred working elsewhere.
  </span>
  While California is still preferred by most, this suggests that it is not
  for everyone. The infamous ‘Cali or Bust’ mentality could have hindered
  some students from exploring opportunities in other cities that may have
  been better suited for them.

<h3> Salary </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    By the last co-op term, compensations tripled in comparison to the first.
  </span>
  Average monthly compensation per co-op term were <b>$2898, $4184, $5688, $7657, $8972, $9624</b> (in CAD, includes housing stipend).
  <br /><br />
  The difference could be explained by the increase in salaries and
  stipends to compensate for the difference in living costs between different
  locations. For example, San Francisco housing typically costs a student between
  $1,500 to $2,500 per month. In comparison, Waterloo housing costs a student
  approximately $700 per month.

<h2> Does X affect job pay? </h2>
<h3> Salary as a metric </h3>
<p class="full">
In order to rank jobs appropriately, salary is used as a proxy metric to
measure job opportunities. Due to the subjectiveness of this metric, the following
results should be taken with a grain of salt because higher salary does not
imply higher job satisfaction.
</p>

<div class="vbx2"></div>
<h3> Grades </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    Grades do not correlate with salary at all.
  </span>
  In other words, having a high cumulative average does not imply that the student
  will get a good salary in the upcoming co-op term. This suggests that there
  are more important factors than grades when it comes to finding a good job.
  <br /><br />
  Some companies do use grades as a cutoff to filter large amounts of candidates.
  However, many companies are aware that grades are not a good indication of how
  performant a student can be during co-op.
  <br /><br />
  This suggests that if a student wanted to optimize for getting the best co-op
  possible, aiming for a higher grade may not yield the desired results, and
  their efforts can be redirected towards other involvements such as side
  projects.

<h3> Gender </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    Women are paid the same as men on average for co-op terms.
  </span>
  This is great to see because this suggests that women and men have equally good
  job opportunities for co-op.
  <br /><br />
  However, this does not suggest that there is no gender bias in the longer term.
  fact, according to <a target="_blank"
    href="https://research-content.glassdoor.com/app/uploads/sites/2/2016/03/Glassdoor-Gender-Pay-Gap-Study.pdf">a
    Glassdoor study</a>,
  "younger workers face a smaller gender pay gap than older workers." This
  finding is not exclusive to the tech industry.

<h3> Years of coding experience </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    Students who started coding earlier were paid similarly compared to students who
    started coding later.
  </span>
  In other words, it doesn't matter if a student started at the age of 13 or 18. This suggests
  that students that started coding later are not at a disadvantage in terms
  of co-op job opportunities.

<h3> Hackathons </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    Students who attended at least one hackathon earned 18% more on average than those that
    didn't attend any.
  </span>
  In other words, students who show passion for building projects get better job
  opportunities than those that don't. Alternatively, this result could be
  because students that attended a hackathon cared more about getting a higher
  paying job.
  <br /> <br />
  Students who attended more than 5 hackathons earned approximately 27% more than
  those that only attended between 1 to 5 hackathons. This could suggest that the
  former had a lot more relevant work to show which is more appealing to
  employers.

<div class="vbx2"></div>
<h3> Side projects </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    Students that build side projects earned 13% more on average than those that
    don't build side projects.
  </span>
  The more time that a student invests into side projects, the more they are likely
  to get paid. Side projects are often seen as the closest thing to software
  work experience, making it a great time investment to compensate for any lack
  of work experience.

  <br /> <br />
  It is important to mention that <b>side projects and hackathons are not the only way to find
  a job</b>. There have been many less practiced methods students have used to
  find job opportunities such as referrals, networking, etc.
  <br /> <br />
  It is just as important to note that <b>students who are not involved in software-related
  extracurriculars still find great jobs</b>. In fact,
  many SE students and faculty encourage pursuing interests besides software.

<h3> Admission average </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    Admission averages have no significant impact on job pay.
  </span>
  A 90 in one school could be harder to achieve than a 99 in another school.
  In other words, admission averages are an inaccurate metric to determine
  how successful someone is because high schools do not standardize their grades
  with each other.

    already called and the receptionist was trying to get a hold of me through my phone. Finally ran up the stairs, 
    15 mins late to my 30 min interview and burst into the room. The interviewer was surprisingly very kind and

    (for some reason I had hung them on the light switch so I found them after 
    I had given up looking and was just going to leave). Finally got there about 30 seconds after they 
    had called me to the interview, but it felt like I was going to be 10 minutes late. 
    (also it was raining so I was a soggy mess by the time I got to the interview)"

<h3> Favourite Co-op Companies </h3>
<p class="full">
  <span class="big">
    With 5-6 co-op experiences under their belt, we wanted to see what companies were among students' favourites and why.
  </span>
  Among 31 respondents, we grouped the written responses among the 8 categories below to see which factors weighed most when choosing their favourite companies.
  <br/>
  Interest in work was the most common factor affecting students' enjoyment at a company. When students are engaged and interested in their work and projects, they get more enjoyment from their co-op experience.
  Following that, factors such as salary, work benefits, culture, and co-worokers were roughly equally important factors.
