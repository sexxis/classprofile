<h1 id="coop">Co-op</h1>
<h3>Companies</h3>
<p class="full">
  <span class="big"> At least 166 companies have hired an SE student. </span>
  Students had the opportunity to work in many different types of environments,
  including lean startups, writing code in Japan, researching with professors,
  and working at large tech companies. While a majority of students were
  software engineers during their co-ops, some explored other areas such as game
  development, product management, and trading.
  <br />
  <br />
  The benefit of having 6 co-op terms is that students get to explore different
  company sizes doing different positions in different cities. This is
  invaluable for students because it helps students figure out what they want
  upon graduation.

<h3>Locations</h3>

  <span class="big">
    Co-ops happened all across North America, and a few across the world!
  </span>
  The majority that co-oped in the US worked in California or on the east coast.
  <br />
  <br />
  Even though the University of Waterloo did not authorize any co-ops outside of
  Canada once the pandemic hit, many respondents said they worked in the US for
  their last few co-ops. This might have been possible due to the University
  lowering the number of required (authorized) co-ops.

<h3>Favourite Locations</h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    30% of respondents picked California as their favourite work location, and
    41% of respondents' favourite work location was in the US. Toronto was a
    close favourite with 24% of respondents picking it as their top choice.
  </span>
  The pandemic likely hindered students from exploring opportunities outside of
  Canada as the percent of US locations dropped from 68% in 2021 to 41% in 2022.
  On the flip side, it is also surprising that California has dropped from 39.6%
  in 2021 to 30% in 2022, which suggests it may not be the right place for
  everyone, especially with the infamous cali or bust mentality.

<h3>Salary</h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    Median hourly compensation increased over time. By the last co-op term,
    compensation had on average increased by 2.8x compared to the first co-op
    term.
  </span>
  Average hourly compensation per co-op term was
  <b>$19.86, $30.14, $38.18, $42.21, $46.37, $51.55</b> (in CAD). <br /><br />
  The difference could be explained by the exchange rate between the USD and the
  CAD, as more respondents started working in the US, and an increase in
  salaries and stipends to compensate for the difference in living costs between
  different locations. As a very loose example, renting in San Francisco
  typically costs between $2,000 to $2,500 per month. In comparison, Waterloo
  housing costs approximately $800 per month.
  <br /><br />
  Note that these values do not include additional compensation such as housing
  stipends.

<h3>Co-op Applications Breakdown</h3>
<p class="full">
  <span class="big">
    As respondents gained work experience, they applied to fewer jobs over time,
    found more jobs outside of WaterlooWorks and returned to previous employers
    more frequently.
  </span>
  Respondents applied to 3 times fewer jobs by their last co-op.

<h3>Co-op Ratings</h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    Most respondents had an "Excellent" or "Outstanding" co-op rating.
  </span>
  Across every co-op term, at least 44% of respondents received an outstanding
  co-op rating and 91% received an excellent co-op rating or higher. During the
  4th and 5th co-op terms, 60% and 59% of respondents received an outstanding.

<h3>Co-op Roles</h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    Respondents worked in a variety of roles, the most popular being fullstack
    and backend roles.
  </span>
  It is important to note that this is not the exact job title from each co-op.
  Rather, it reflects the various roles that respondents took. Respondents were
  able to select any number of roles per co-op.

<h3>Interviews</h3>

  Over the co-op interview cycles, respondents sometimes missed an interview or
  were late to interviews. Additionally, many respondents have bombed (did
  extremely poorly on) at least one of their interviews.

<h2>Does X affect job pay?</h2>
<h3>Salary as a metric</h3>
<p class="full">
  In order to rank jobs appropriately, salary is used as a proxy metric to
  measure job opportunities. Due to the limited expressiveness of this metric,
  the following results should be taken with a grain of salt because higher
  salary does not imply higher job satisfaction.
</p>

<div class="vbx2"></div>
<h3>Grades</h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    There is no clear correlation between grades and salary.
  </span>
  In other words, having a high cumulative average does not imply that the
  student will get a good salary in the upcoming co-op term. This suggests that
  there are more important factors than grades when it comes to finding a good
  job.
  <br /><br />
  Some companies do use grades as a cutoff to filter large candidate pools.
  However, many companies are aware that grades are not a good indication of how
  performant a student can be during co-op.

<h3>Gender</h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big"> On average, women are paid less during co-ops. </span>

  The most significant gap occured during the 4th and 5th co-ops. Although the
  data trends indicate that women are paid less than men, it is difficult to
  determine which portion of the compensation difference is due solely to gender
  bias, as opposed to other causes.
  <br /><br />
  Note: There were about 39 men and 14 women who responded to co-op salaries.
