    From classmates to friends..?
  </span>
  We asked SEs to recall what the most touching thing a fellow classmate
  had done for them. The following responses are either directly quoted or
  rephrased from the original submissions.
</p>
<div class="hvb"></div>
<h6>The most touching thing that a classmate has done for me was...</h6>
<p class="quote">
  Sticking by my side since day 1.
  <br /><br />
  Pulling an all nighter to help me with an assignment they had already finished.
  <br /><br />
  Reaching out during COVID. The number of people (myself included now!) who've
  just touched base to have little catchup calls, who I probably wouldn't have
  talked to too much in person, has been really sweet.
  <br /><br />
  To help me travel home on St Patrick's day when I was blackout drunk.
  <br /><br />
  Supporting me when I needed help in a foreign country.
  <br /><br />
  To give me notes.
  <br /><br />
  When one classmate introduced me to his friends and made me feel super welcome
  when I transferred into SE. It was super awesome of him to do so and those
  [friends] were the friends I stuck with throughout SE.
  <br /><br />
  Hosting a surprise party for my birthday.
  <br /><br />
  Staying up with me after a breakup
  <br /><br />
  One time my classmate bought us a PS5 so we could play Call of Duty in between
  assignments.
  <br /><br />
  So many, I can't even think of what was the "most" touching.
