<h3> Food Preparation </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    Walmart won the hearts (and stomachs) of most SE students, followed by a
    near equal split of the remaining stores.
  </span>
  Costco seems to have the least appeal, and T&T has grown quickly considering it
  opened halfway through the program (just before the 3A term).

  </span>
  SE students cooked often, with ~77% doing so on an almost daily basis.
  That being said, this does not mean that respondents are master chefs.

<h3> Dining </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    Kinkaku's AYCE sushi proved to be a fan-favourite amongst SE students.
  </span>
  Beer Town, Baba Grill, Kabob Hut, Bao Sandwich Bar, and Shinwa were also
  liked by visitors.

  making dining a special event.

<h3> Sleep </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
  Students clearly value sleeping at reasonable times
  </span>
  The most popular answer was 2 AM, at which point ~84% of SE students
  have gone to sleep. However, some students still prefer sleeping late,
  possibly due to work or personal reasons (gaming).
  <br /> <br />
  Sleeping after 6 AM might sound crazy, but then again, some of these students
  also willingly go to 24 hour hackathons.

  Future students will be glad to see that studying SE does not mean sacrificing
  sleep. In fact, ~77% of students sleep >= 7 hours on average, which is the
  <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/about_sleep/how_much_sleep.html"> recommended amount for adults by the CDC.</a>

<h3> Travel Locations </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    Via coop and exchange, Waterloo SE students have had many
    opportunities to travel across the world.
  </span>
  California and Europe as large regions seem the commonly favoured,
  likely due to their dominance for coop and exchange respectively.

<h3> Extracurriculars </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    Unlike high school, just over half of students were not involved in any
    extracurriculars during undergrad.
  </span>
  However a substantial amount did get involved for a few academic terms. 
  <br></br>
  We hope that future SEs will buck this trend of disengagement by past classes.

<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    Engineering design teams were not pursued.
  </span>
  Only 24% of respondents joined a student design team, with none being
  part of one for more than 3 terms. 
  <br></br>
  A likely reason is that software projects can often be done in isolation,
  allowing a more flexible schedule for students looking to sharpen their skills.

    SE students who exercise enjoy sports and weight training the most.
  </span>
  Hiking and Running are the two next most favoured exercise methods.

<h3> Partying </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    Making time for fun.
  </span>
  At least 38% of respondents went out/partied once a month, with ~18%
  doing so a few times a week. Only 11% said they never partied. This
  somewhat goes against the stereotype of SE students being antisocial,
  however this is still not an overwhelmingly outgoing group.

<h3> Things That Make Us Happy </h3>

    "Friends are the artists who paint happy lips on your face."
  </span>
  - Richelle E. Goodrich
  <br/>
  Spending time with friends made SE 21 the most happy, followed by cooking and/or
  eating food. Enjoying familial presence came in third.

<h3> Where Our Hobbies Lie </h3>
<p class="full">
  <span class="big">
    Did cooking as a hobby lead to cooking often, or was it the other way around?
  </span>
  Cooking was the top stated unique hobby, but sports dominated the hobby landscape.
  One person responded that they felt that they had lost hobbies, instead of picking
  one up, in the past 5 years.
