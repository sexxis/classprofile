<h1> About the program </h1>
<p class="full">
  The University of Waterloo’s Software Engineering (SE) is an interdisciplinary
  program supported by both the Faculty of Mathematics and the Faculty of
  Engineering. For 5 years, all 92 graduating students of the class of 2021 spent 8
  semesters in school with similar schedules as well as 6 co-ops.
  <br /><br />
  SE is commonly compared to Computer Science, and is often seen as its more-constrained,
  engineering-oriented counterpart. Prospective students may wonder whether SE
  is the right fit for them, and whether they’ll enjoy the environment. This
  profile attempts to showcase who SE 2021 students are, what they've done, and
  how university went for students.

<h1> Preface </h1>

<p class="full">
The findings in this report were derived from the results of a class survey.
In total, 66 out of 92 (72%) graduating students, and 7 who were in SE but
transferred out, responded. An addendum survey was also sent out, where
45 more responses were retrieved from a subset of the previous respondants.
  <br /><br />

SE classes can vary significantly depending on the year, so generalize from
this survey to other classes at your own risk.

Study terms are defined as 1A, 1B, 2A, up to 4B (8 terms). 4 month co-op terms
occur after every study term starting after 1B and ending before 4B. Government
shutdowns due to the Covid-19 virus began in March 2020, partway through the 5th
co-op term. The 4A and 4B study terms were both done remotely due to the pandemic.
The final coop term was also conducted remotely for most students.
<br /><br />

All analysis involving income is expressed in Canadian dollars (CAD). The exchange
rate used to convert from USD to CAD depends on time so a rate of 1.3 was chosen as
it is an approximate average of it over the past 5 years, used to make comparisons
easier. All salaries include monthly housing stipend or the monthly cost of
corporate housing if applicable.

<br /><br />
This constent of this class profile was inspired by the many across Waterloo
Engineering that preceded it, with the presentation being a variation of the
<a href="https://classprofile.andyzhang.net/">
  2018 Software Engineering one created by Andy Zhang
</a>.
It is our hope that the groundwork set by Andy will be iterated on by future classes,
as we did, in order to take future profiles to new heights.
