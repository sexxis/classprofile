<h1> About the Program </h1>
<p class="full">
  Software Engineering (SE) at the University of Waterloo is an interdisciplinary
  program supported by both the Faculty of Mathematics and the Faculty of
  Engineering. For 5 years, all 92 graduating students of the class of 2021 (SE'XXI or SEXXI)
  spent 8 semesters in school with similar schedules as well as 6 co-ops.
  Undergraduates in the Software Engineering program are awarded a Bachelor
  of Software Engineering (BSE) degree (by request, the diploma may say Baccalaureate of Software Engineering) at the end of their 4 & 
  2/3rds year journey.
  <br /><br />
  SE is commonly compared to Computer Science, and is often seen as its more-constrained,
  Engineering-oriented counterpart. Prospective students may wonder whether SE
  is the right fit for them, and whether theyâ€™ll enjoy the environment. This
  profile attempts to showcase who SE 2021 students are, what they've done, and
  how they had experienced university.
  <br /><br />
  This profile is not affiliated with the SE program or the University of Waterloo
  in any way.

<h1> Preface </h1>

<p class="full">
The findings in this report were derived from the results of a class survey.
In total, 66 out of 92 (72%) graduating students, and 7 who were in SE but
transferred out, responded.
<br /><br />

Respondents who had transferred out of SE had completed at least
2 years (4 study terms) in the Software Engineering program with the SE 2021 cohort.
<br /><br />

An addendum survey was also sent out, where
45 more responses were retrieved, likely from a subset of previous
respondents.
<br /><br />

SE classes can vary significantly depending on the year, so generalize from
this survey to other classes at your own risk.
<br /><br />

Study terms are defined as 1A, 1B, 2A, up to 4B (8 terms). 4 month co-op terms
occur after every study term starting after 1B and ending before 4B. Government
shutdowns due to the Covid-19 virus began in March 2020, partway through the 5th
co-op term. The 4A and 4B study terms were both done remotely due to the pandemic.
The final co-op term was also conducted remotely for most students.
<br /><br />

All analysis involving income is expressed in Canadian dollars (CAD). A
constant rate of 1 USD to 1.3 CAD was used to make comparisons consistent and
simple. As this rate varied over time, 1.3 was chosen due to its being an
approximate average USD to CAD exchange rate over the past 5 years. All
income totals include monthly housing stipends or the monthly cost of corporate
housing if applicable.

<br /><br />
The content of this class profile was inspired by the many profiles across Waterloo
Engineering that preceded it, with the presentation being a variation of the
<a href="https://classprofile.andyzhang.net/">
  2018 Software Engineering one created by Andy Zhang
</a>.
It is our hope that the groundwork set by Andy & others will be iterated on by
future classes, as we did, in order to take future profiles to new heights.
