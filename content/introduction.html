<h1>About the program</h1>
<p class="full">
  Software Engineering (SE) at the University of Waterloo is an
  interdisciplinary program supported by both the Faculty of Mathematics and the
  Faculty of Engineering. Students spent 8 semesters in school with similar
  schedules and also gained work experience over 6 co-ops. Undergraduates in the
  Software Engineering program are awarded a Bachelor of Software Engineering
  (BSE) degree (by request, the diploma may say Baccalaureate of Software
  Engineering) at the end of their 4 ⅔-year journey.
  <br /><br />
  SE is commonly compared to Computer Science, and is often seen as its
  more-constrained, Engineering-oriented counterpart. Prospective students may
  wonder whether SE is the right fit for them, and whether they’ll enjoy the
  environment. This profile attempts to showcase who SE 2022 students are, what
  they've done, and what their journey through university was like. <br /><br />
  This profile is not affiliated with the SE program or the University of
  Waterloo in any way.

<h1>Preface</h1>

<p class="full">
  The findings in this report were derived from the results of a class survey.
  In total, 66 graduating students responded.
  <br /><br />

  SE classes can vary significantly depending on the year, so generalize from
  this survey to other classes at your own risk.
  <br /><br />

  Study terms are defined as 1A, 1B, 2A, up to 4B (8 terms). 4 month co-op terms
  occur after every study term starting after 1B and ending before 4B.
  Government shutdowns due to the Covid-19 virus began in February 2020, partway
  through the 3A study term.
  <br /><br />

  All analysis involving income is expressed in Canadian dollars (CAD). A
  constant rate of 1 USD to 1.3 CAD was used to make comparisons consistent and
  simple. As this rate varied over time, 1.3 was chosen due to its being an
  approximate average USD to CAD exchange rate over the past 5 years.

  The content of this class profile was inspired by the many profiles across
  Waterloo Engineering that preceded it.
