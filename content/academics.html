<h3>Grades</h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    3A to 4A averages were higher than 1A to 2B averages.
  </span>
  Classes moved online from 3A onwards, altering the format of assessments. This
  along with more freedom of choice for courses seems to have led to higher
  class averages.

  respondents might have enjoyed their 4A & 4B classes more as they get to
  select almost all of their classes. On the other hand, some respondents may
  have preferred attending courses asynchronously.

<h3>Overloading</h3>

  housing costs stayed around $2000 to $4000. However, for the first fully
